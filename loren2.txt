Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone; Born 20 September 1934, known professionally as
Sophia Loren), is an Italian actress. She was named by the American Film Institute as one 
of the greatest female stars of Classical Hollywood cinema.[2] As of 2022, Loren is one of 
the last surviving major stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema and is the only 
remaining living person on AFI's list.

Encouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her 
film career at age sixteen in 1950. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in 
the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with Paramount in 1956 launched
her international career. Her film appearances around this time include The Pride and the 
Passion, Houseboat, and It Started in Naples. During the 1950s, she starred in films as a 
sexually emancipated persona and was one of the best known sex symbols of the time.
